# Noah Read's Personal Project Website

Hello everyone! I made this website to showcase some projects that I have worked on as I work towards becoming a data scientist (or any role that is interesting and technical, really...). 

As of July 2025 the one project that has been uploaded (other than my Masters thesis) has been deployed via Render, which has a free hosting tier that unfortunately takes some time to spin up when there has been inactivity. Down the line, hopefully I can implement some different hosting method to make the experience more efficient. Nevertheless, if you are checking out the stock project, Render's server spin-up time is < 60 seconds, so hang in there.

If you have any advice or want to connect with me for any reason, I'm all ears. My email address is on my website <a><href="noahcread.com>here</a>.
